# EDA And Data Preprocessing for Netflix Data in ML

This project focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing of Netflix data to prepare it for machine learning. The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and an initial inspection was performed to understand its structure. Data cleaning steps included removing duplicates and null values, renaming and converting columns to appropriate data types, and modifying columns as needed. During the EDA phase, data distribution was analyzed using descriptive statistics, histograms, and box plots, while relationships were explored through correlation matrices and scatter plots. Outliers were detected, and insights were visualized using bar charts and heatmaps. For machine learning preparation, categorical variables were encoded using one-hot or label encoding, feature scaling was applied using MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler, and feature engineering was performed to enhance predictive power. The dataset was then split into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing sets, with the final dataset shapes printed for verification. The project utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
